# IMDB-Movie-Data-and-Machine-Learning

This is the final project for MIS 665.

For the interactive Plotly graphs to display, here is a link to a Jupyter notebook viewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TMallinson/IMDB-Movie-Data-and-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Mallinson_T_FinalProject.ipynb

*Note: No Plotly graphs were used in the machine learning portion of this project, only the business analytics first-half.
